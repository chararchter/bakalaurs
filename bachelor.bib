abstract = "The effect of clouds on total and UV-B irradiance in Córdoba, Argentina, was studied employing the TUV 4.1 model and measurements obtained with YES UVB-1 and YES TSP-700 radiometers, and a spectral radiometer Ocean Optics USB-4000. The experimental measurements were selected from a 10 years dataset (1999–2008). Clouds were classified by direct observation as cirrus, cumulus, and stratocumulus. The broadband Cloud Modification Factors (CMFs) have been calculated in the range of the total and the UV-B radiation for these types of clouds. The relations between them were analyzed for a significant number of days. The broadband CMF values range from around 0.1 up to 1.25, depending on the wavelength interval and on the cloud type. The CMFUVB versus CMFT plots for different clouds have shown good adjustments and significant differences, which allows the distinction between them. Stratocumulus clouds show large attenuations and a linear relation with larger slopes as the solar zenith angle (SZA) increases. For this type of clouds an average slope of (1.0 ± 0.2) was found. The relation between the CMF for cumulus clouds is linear with an average slope of (0.61 ± 0.01). No dependence with the SZA was observed. Cirrus clouds plots show an exponential behavior with fit parameters equal to (0.48 ± 0.08) and (0.68 ± 0.15). However, when small SZA intervals are analyzed a linear relation is found. When the relations between the CMF were similar (cumulus and cirrus), the spectral variation in the UV range (320–420 nm) of a modified CMF (CMFm) was used to distinguish them. Hence, the spectral differences among the three types of clouds have been also analyzed for several days and SZA. Here, it was found that the effect of cirrus is essentially wavelength independent while cumulus and stratocumulus clouds show exponential decay relations but with different ordinates. In the analyzed relations the microphysical properties of the clouds seem to determine its behavior while the optical thickness leads to the different degrees of attenuation. The results obtained in this work are in agreement with those found for other authors."

Collocated satellite and surface measurements of solar radiation at five geographically diverse locations showed significant solar absorption by clouds, resulting in about 25 watts per square meter more global-mean absorption by the cloudy atmosphere than predicted by theoretical models. It has often been suggested that tropospheric aerosols could increase cloud absorption. But these aerosols are temporally and spatially heterogeneous, whereas the observed cloud absorption is remarkably invariant with respect to season and location. Although its physical cause is unknown, enhanced cloud absorption substantially alters our understanding of the atmosphere{\textquoteright}s energy budget.},

A decline in solar radiation at land surfaces has become apparent in many observational records up to 1990, a phenomenon known as global dimming. Newly available surface observations from 1990 to the present, primarily from the Northern Hemisphere, show that the dimming did not persist into the 1990s. Instead, a widespread brightening has been observed since the late 1980s. This reversal is reconcilable with changes in cloudiness and atmospheric transmission and may substantially affect surface climate, the hydrological cycle, glaciers, and ecosystems.},

The energy in sunlight can be converted into electricity, heat, or fuel. Although the costs of solar panels have declined rapidly, technology gaps still exist for achieving cost-effective scalable deployment combined with storage technologies to provide reliable, dispatchable energy.ADVANCESThe costs of Si-based solar panels have declined so rapidly that panel costs now make up \&lt;30\% of the costs of a fully installed solar-electricity system. Research and development (R\&amp;D) opportunities hence lie in the development of very high efficiency conversion materials, to advantageously leverage the associated reduction in area-related balance-of-systems costs. Such materials would optimally either leverage or mate with existing, low-cost Si photovoltaic (PV) technology. },

The number of variables which can influence this make it necessary to standarize on set values of glass thickness and extinction coefficent and liner reflectance. The variables considered are the day of the year, latitude, cover slope, orientation, percentage diffuse radiation and insolation intermittency. The complexity of the resulting functions, together with the number of varibles, makes it difficult to accurately predict what the still mean effective absorptance will be for a given set of conditions. It is found that insolation intermittency has an insignificant effect and that the greater the daily proportion of diffuse radiation, the lower the absorptance. Using the equations presented, a mean effective absorptance can be calculated for any given combination of the variables."

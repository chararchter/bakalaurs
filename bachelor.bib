abstract="The record of total solar irradiance (TSI) during the past 35 years has overlapping observations from space which can be merged to a composite, and three are available, namely the PMOD, the ACRIM and the IRMB composites. There are important differences between them, which are discussed in detail in order to find the best representation of solar variability during the last three cycles, for the following discussions of solar irradiance variability. Moreover, the absolute value of TSI from TIM on SORCE is 1,361 Wm−2, substantially lower than the value 1,365 Wm−2, which was observed by the classical radiometers. New results from specific experiments are now available, which are discussed in order to define the value to be used in, e.g., climate models. The most important issue regarding the recent TSI records is the low value observed during the minimum in 2009, which is 25{\%} of a typical cycle amplitude lower than the value in 1996. The validity of this low value has been confirmed by comparing all existing TSI observations during cycle 23. On the other hand, activity indices, such as the sunspot number, the 10.7-cm radio flux (F10.7), the CaII and MgII indices and also the Ly-$\alpha$ irradiance or the frequency changes in low-order p modes, show a much smaller decreases relative to their respective typical cycle amplitude. It is most likely that an increasing contrast of the facular and network elements with decreasing magnetic field is responsible for this discrepancy. The value of TSI at minima is correlated with the open magnetic field of the Sun, BR, at minima. Using BR at minima, interpolated linearly in between as a fourth component of a proxy model based on the photometric sunspot index and on the MgII index improves the explanation of the variance of TSI over the full period of the last three solar cycles to 84.7{\%}. Results from other models are also discussed.",

abstract = "The effect of clouds on total and UV-B irradiance in Córdoba, Argentina, was studied employing the TUV 4.1 model and measurements obtained with YES UVB-1 and YES TSP-700 radiometers, and a spectral radiometer Ocean Optics USB-4000. The experimental measurements were selected from a 10 years dataset (1999–2008). Clouds were classified by direct observation as cirrus, cumulus, and stratocumulus. The broadband Cloud Modification Factors (CMFs) have been calculated in the range of the total and the UV-B radiation for these types of clouds. The relations between them were analyzed for a significant number of days. The broadband CMF values range from around 0.1 up to 1.25, depending on the wavelength interval and on the cloud type. The CMFUVB versus CMFT plots for different clouds have shown good adjustments and significant differences, which allows the distinction between them. Stratocumulus clouds show large attenuations and a linear relation with larger slopes as the solar zenith angle (SZA) increases. For this type of clouds an average slope of (1.0 ± 0.2) was found. The relation between the CMF for cumulus clouds is linear with an average slope of (0.61 ± 0.01). No dependence with the SZA was observed. Cirrus clouds plots show an exponential behavior with fit parameters equal to (0.48 ± 0.08) and (0.68 ± 0.15). However, when small SZA intervals are analyzed a linear relation is found. When the relations between the CMF were similar (cumulus and cirrus), the spectral variation in the UV range (320–420 nm) of a modified CMF (CMFm) was used to distinguish them. Hence, the spectral differences among the three types of clouds have been also analyzed for several days and SZA. Here, it was found that the effect of cirrus is essentially wavelength independent while cumulus and stratocumulus clouds show exponential decay relations but with different ordinates. In the analyzed relations the microphysical properties of the clouds seem to determine its behavior while the optical thickness leads to the different degrees of attenuation. The results obtained in this work are in agreement with those found for other authors."

abstract = {In Lauder, Central Otago, New Zealand, two all-sky imaging systems have been in operation for more than 1 yr, measuring the total, opaque, and thin cloud fraction, as well as indicating whether the sun is obscured by clouds. The data provide a basis for investigating the impact of clouds on the surface radiation field. The all-sky cloud parameters were combined with measurements of global, direct, and diffuse surface solar irradiance over the spectral interval from 0.3 to 3 μm. Here, the results of ongoing analysis of this dataset are described. As a reference for the magnitude of the cloud influence, clear-sky irradiance values are estimated as a simple function of solar zenith angle and the earth–sun distance. The function is derived from a least squares fit to measurements taken when available cloud images show clear-sky situations. Averaged over a longer time period, such as 1 month, cloud fraction and surface irradiance are clearly negatively correlated. Monthly means in the ratio of the measured surface irradiance to the clear-sky value had a correlation coefficient of about −0.9 with means of cloud fraction for the months from July 2000 to June 2001. In the present work reductions in the surface irradiance and situations in which clouds cause radiation values to exceed the expected clear-sky amount are analyzed. Over 1 yr of observations, 1-min-averaged radiation measurements exceeding the expected clear-sky value by more than 10\% were observed with a frequency of 5\%. In contrast, a reduction of more than 10\% below estimated clear-sky values occurred in 66\% of the cases, while clear-sky irradiances (measured irradiance within ±10\% of estimated clear-sky value) were observed 29\% of the time. Low cloud fractions frequently lead to moderate enhancement, because the sun is often unobscured and the clouds are brighter than the sky that they hide. As cloud fraction increases the sun is likely to be obscured, causing irradiance values to fall well below clear-sky values. However, in the case of unobscured sun, there is a tendency for strongest enhancements when cloud fractions are highest. Enhancements, especially at high solar zenith angle, are also often observed in association with thin clouds. }

Collocated satellite and surface measurements of solar radiation at five geographically diverse locations showed significant solar absorption by clouds, resulting in about 25 watts per square meter more global-mean absorption by the cloudy atmosphere than predicted by theoretical models. It has often been suggested that tropospheric aerosols could increase cloud absorption. But these aerosols are temporally and spatially heterogeneous, whereas the observed cloud absorption is remarkably invariant with respect to season and location. Although its physical cause is unknown, enhanced cloud absorption substantially alters our understanding of the atmosphere{\textquoteright}s energy budget.},

Instead, a widespread brightening has been observed since the late 1980s. This reversal is reconcilable with changes in cloudiness and atmospheric transmission and may substantially affect surface climate, the hydrological cycle, glaciers, and ecosystems.},

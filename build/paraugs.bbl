    \field{abstract}{%
    There has been a long history of unexplained anomalous absorption of solar
  radiation by clouds. Collocated satellite and surface measurements of solar
  radiation at five geographically diverse locations showed significant solar
  absorption by clouds, resulting in about 25 watts per square meter more
  global-mean absorption by the cloudy atmosphere than predicted by theoretical
  models. It has often been suggested that tropospheric aerosols could increase
  cloud absorption. But these aerosols are temporally and spatially
  heterogeneous, whereas the observed cloud absorption is remarkably invariant
  with respect to season and location. Although its physical cause is unknown,
  enhanced cloud absorption substantially alters our understanding of the
  atmosphere{\textquoteright}s energy budget.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    The record of total solar irradiance (TSI) during the past 35 years has
  overlapping observations from space which can be merged to a composite, and
  three are available, namely the PMOD, the ACRIM and the IRMB composites.
  There are important differences between them, which are discussed in detail
  in order to find the best representation of solar variability during the last
  three cycles, for the following discussions of solar irradiance variability.
  Moreover, the absolute value of TSI from TIM on SORCE is 1,361 Wm−2,
  substantially lower than the value 1,365 Wm−2, which was observed by the
  classical radiometers. New results from specific experiments are now
  available, which are discussed in order to define the value to be used in,
  e.g., climate models. The most important issue regarding the recent TSI
  records is the low value observed during the minimum in 2009, which is 25{\%}
  of a typical cycle amplitude lower than the value in 1996. The validity of
  this low value has been confirmed by comparing all existing TSI observations
  during cycle 23. On the other hand, activity indices, such as the sunspot
  number, the 10.7-cm radio flux (F10.7), the CaII and MgII indices and also
  the Ly-$\alpha$ irradiance or the frequency changes in low-order p modes,
  show a much smaller decreases relative to their respective typical cycle
  amplitude. It is most likely that an increasing contrast of the facular and
  network elements with decreasing magnetic field is responsible for this
  discrepancy. The value of TSI at minima is correlated with the open magnetic
  field of the Sun, BR, at minima. Using BR at minima, interpolated linearly
  in between as a fourth component of a proxy model based on the photometric
  sunspot index and on the MgII index improves the explanation of the variance
  of TSI over the full period of the last three solar cycles to 84.7{\%}.
  Results from other models are also discussed.%

    Despite providing a relatively small percentage of total global energy
  supply, solar energy systems generally receive enthusiastic support from
  technologists, regulators, politicians, and environmental groups. The energy
  in sunlight can be converted into electricity, heat, or fuel. Although the
  costs of solar panels have declined rapidly, technology gaps still exist for
  achieving cost-effective scalable deployment combined with storage
  technologies to provide reliable, dispatchable energy.ADVANCESThe costs of
  Si-based solar panels have declined so rapidly that panel costs now make up
  \&lt;30\% of the costs of a fully installed solar-electricity system.
  Research and development (R\&amp;D) opportunities hence lie in the
  development of very high efficiency conversion materials, to advantageously
  leverage the associated reduction in area-related balance-of-systems costs.
  Such materials would optimally either leverage or mate with existing,
  low-cost Si photovoltaic (PV) technology.%

    The effect of clouds on total and UV-B irradiance in Córdoba, Argentina,
  was studied employing the TUV 4.1 model and measurements obtained with YES
  UVB-1 and YES TSP-700 radiometers, and a spectral radiometer Ocean Optics
  USB-4000. The experimental measurements were selected from a 10 years dataset
  (1999–2008). Clouds were classified by direct observation as cirrus,
  cumulus, and stratocumulus. The broadband Cloud Modification Factors (CMFs)
  have been calculated in the range of the total and the UV-B radiation for
  these types of clouds. The relations between them were analyzed for a
  significant number of days. The broadband CMF values range from around 0.1 up
  to 1.25, depending on the wavelength interval and on the cloud type. The
  CMFUVB versus CMFT plots for different clouds have shown good adjustments and
  significant differences, which allows the distinction between them.
  Stratocumulus clouds show large attenuations and a linear relation with
  larger slopes as the solar zenith angle (SZA) increases. For this type of
  clouds an average slope of (1.0 ± 0.2) was found. The relation between the
  CMF for cumulus clouds is linear with an average slope of (0.61 ± 0.01).
  No dependence with the SZA was observed. Cirrus clouds plots show an
  exponential behavior with fit parameters equal to (0.48 ± 0.08) and
  (0.68 ± 0.15). However, when small SZA intervals are analyzed a linear
  relation is found. When the relations between the CMF were similar (cumulus
  and cirrus), the spectral variation in the UV range (320–420 nm) of a
  modified CMF (CMFm) was used to distinguish them. Hence, the spectral
  differences among the three types of clouds have been also analyzed for
  several days and SZA. Here, it was found that the effect of cirrus is
  essentially wavelength independent while cumulus and stratocumulus clouds
  show exponential decay relations but with different ordinates. In the
  analyzed relations the microphysical properties of the clouds seem to
  determine its behavior while the optical thickness leads to the different
  degrees of attenuation. The results obtained in this work are in agreement
  with those found for other authors.%

    In Lauder, Central Otago, New Zealand, two all-sky imaging systems have
  been in operation for more than 1 yr, measuring the total, opaque, and thin
  cloud fraction, as well as indicating whether the sun is obscured by clouds.
  The data provide a basis for investigating the impact of clouds on the
  surface radiation field. The all-sky cloud parameters were combined with
  measurements of global, direct, and diffuse surface solar irradiance over the
  spectral interval from 0.3 to 3 μm. Here, the results of ongoing analysis of
  this dataset are described. As a reference for the magnitude of the cloud
  influence, clear-sky irradiance values are estimated as a simple function of
  solar zenith angle and the earth–sun distance. The function is derived from
  a least squares fit to measurements taken when available cloud images show
  clear-sky situations. Averaged over a longer time period, such as 1 month,
  cloud fraction and surface irradiance are clearly negatively correlated.
  Monthly means in the ratio of the measured surface irradiance to the
  clear-sky value had a correlation coefficient of about −0.9 with means of
  cloud fraction for the months from July 2000 to June 2001. In the present
  work reductions in the surface irradiance and situations in which clouds
  cause radiation values to exceed the expected clear-sky amount are analyzed.
  Over 1 yr of observations, 1-min-averaged radiation measurements exceeding
  the expected clear-sky value by more than 10\% were observed with a frequency
  of 5\%. In contrast, a reduction of more than 10\% below estimated clear-sky
  values occurred in 66\% of the cases, while clear-sky irradiances (measured
  irradiance within ±10\% of estimated clear-sky value) were observed 29\% of
  the time. Low cloud fractions frequently lead to moderate enhancement,
  because the sun is often unobscured and the clouds are brighter than the sky
  that they hide. As cloud fraction increases the sun is likely to be obscured,
  causing irradiance values to fall well below clear-sky values. However, in
  the case of unobscured sun, there is a tendency for strongest enhancements
  when cloud fractions are highest. Enhancements, especially at high solar
  zenith angle, are also often observed in association with thin clouds.%

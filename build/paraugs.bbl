    The record of total solar irradiance (TSI) during the past 35 years has
  overlapping observations from space which can be merged to a composite, and
  three are available, namely the PMOD, the ACRIM and the IRMB composites.
  There are important differences between them, which are discussed in detail
  in order to find the best representation of solar variability during the last
  three cycles, for the following discussions of solar irradiance variability.
  Moreover, the absolute value of TSI from TIM on SORCE is 1,361 Wm−2,
  substantially lower than the value 1,365 Wm−2, which was observed by the
  classical radiometers. New results from specific experiments are now
  available, which are discussed in order to define the value to be used in,
  e.g., climate models. The most important issue regarding the recent TSI
  records is the low value observed during the minimum in 2009, which is 25{\%}
  of a typical cycle amplitude lower than the value in 1996. The validity of
  this low value has been confirmed by comparing all existing TSI observations
  during cycle 23. On the other hand, activity indices, such as the sunspot
  number, the 10.7-cm radio flux (F10.7), the CaII and MgII indices and also
  the Ly-$\alpha$ irradiance or the frequency changes in low-order p modes,
  show a much smaller decreases relative to their respective typical cycle
  amplitude. It is most likely that an increasing contrast of the facular and
  network elements with decreasing magnetic field is responsible for this
  discrepancy. The value of TSI at minima is correlated with the open magnetic
  field of the Sun, BR, at minima. Using BR at minima, interpolated linearly
  in between as a fourth component of a proxy model based on the photometric
  sunspot index and on the MgII index improves the explanation of the variance
  of TSI over the full period of the last three solar cycles to 84.7{\%}.
  Results from other models are also discussed.%

The aim of this thesis is to determine the most efficient way of solar panel arrangement for typical weather conditions in Latvia. 
Based on two types of solar panels placed in five different spatial orientations in the University of Latvia Botanical Garden area, the dependency of the efficiency of solar panels on following variable parameters will be established:
1) meteorological conditions
2) spatial orientation
3) month of year
4) type of solar panels.\\
The results of monitoring will be analyzed in the context of a physics based assessment of the effectiveness of these panels.
